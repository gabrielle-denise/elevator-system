Each cell of the table contains a tuple where the first coordinate
refers to the utility gained by player 1 if player 1 acts according to the
row's action. The second coordinate refers to the utility gained by player 2
if player 2 acts according to the column's action.

For instance, under row P1 BETRAY and column P2 BETRAY, we have the tuple
(5,5), which indicates that if P1 betrays and P2 betrays, then both gain utility
5. On the other hand, under row P1 BETRAY and column P2 SILENT, we have the
tuple (3,0) which indicates that if P1 betrays and P2 stays silent, then P2
gains nothing but P1 gains a utility of 3.

Implement the utility function as utility1 below, where utility1 takes in
2 inputs. The first input is a player datatype, and the second is a
strategy datatype, where both player and strategy are defined for you above.

Theorem natpax8 : peanoax8 nat O S.
Proof.
  unfold peanoax8.

(*
7.d (1pt). Prove Theorem natisapeanomodel which states that nat is a model of the Peano Axioms.

Theorem natisapeanomodel : isapeanomodel nat O (S O) S plus mult le.
Proof.
  unfold isapeanomodel.

(*
7.e (1pt). The Axiom groupaxone is one of the axioms of Group Theory. Define the proposition
notgroupaxone which is the negation of groupaxone.
*)

Definition groupaxone (X : Type) (o : X) (p : X -> X -> X) : Prop :=
forall (x : X), exists (y : X), p x y = o.

Definition notgroupaxone (X : Type) (o : X) (p : X -> X -> X) : Prop :=
  groupaxone X o p -> False.


(*
7.f (1pt). Prove Theorem natisnotagroup which states that nat fails to satisfy Axiom groupaxone,
so that nat is not a model of Group Theory.
*)

Theorem natisnotagroup : notgroupaxone nat O plus.
Proof.
  unfold notgroupaxone, groupaxone.
  intro Hgroup.
  destruct (Hgroup (S O)) as [y Hy].
  simpl in Hy.
  discriminate Hy.
